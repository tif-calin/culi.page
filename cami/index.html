      Cami is a calico cat who's lived her entire life in the Parkwest Apartments. She's neutered and very friendly towards <i>Homo sapiens</i> but can sometimes get defensive around other cats. Cami has been here for over two years and has made many friends during that time, mainly around the Eastern half of the 3701 block.

      <h2>To Note</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Cami is allowed outdoors every day until 3pm</b>. During Spring we often let her out a little later and during Winter we often bring her in a little earlier. She has a tracker on her that allows us to more easily locate her when it's time to bring her in.</li>
        <li><b>Please don't feed Cami</b>. She is on a particular diet and schedule since we do not free feed her. Feeding her at atypical hours of the day makes it harder for her to adjust to her feeding schedule. If you'd like to give her treats, please feel free to reach out to the numbers below and we'd be happy to give you a jar of some good quality treats we use.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>F.A.Q.</h2>
      <dl>
        <dd>Can Cami come into our home?</dd>
        <dt>This is generally fine as long as you either leave the door open for her to leave or are carefully watching her to know when she wants to leave. Mainly, we just ask that: 1. she's out before 3pm; 2. you don't give her food or treats indoors since we don't want her to develop a habit of going into people's homes. Please note: If a neighbor ever complains about her entering their home we may change our mind and ask that she never be let indoors.</dt>
        <dd>Can I pick her up?</dd>
        <dt>She usually doesn't like being picked up. She won't scratch (unless you're being really aggressive or she's trying to run away in fear from something) but she will meow to tell you she don't want it. There's a specific way she seems to most reliably like being picked up with. You can try practicing. We just ask that as soon as she starts crying you respect her wishes and put her down.</dt>
