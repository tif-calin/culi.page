        My name is Culi (<i>kuh-lee</i>). I use <a href="https://pronoun.is/they/.../themselves">they/them</a> or <a href="https://pronoun.is/they/.../themself">he/him</a> pronouns. I play with <a href="https://github.com/tif-calin/">code a lot</a> (currently mainly JS, TS, Ruby, Python, and occasionally try out Rust or Clojure but there&apos;s never have enough time), but if you're here for that you probably meant to check out <a href="https://work.culi.page">my portfolio site</a>! Although I really enjoy coding, code tends to just act as the glue that allows me to tie together my varied interests including, but not limited to:

      <h2>What&apos;s there to do here?</h2>
      <p>
        I do this thing where I make some main repo for my million of quick project ideas. Usually it serves as a nest for projects and if I'm really into it I'll spin it up into a separate project. A good example is my project VoteVote which is a little toy I'm working on to allow you to compare dozens of different voting systems in one go using color as a metaphor. Voters and candidates are both represented by color and how much a voter prefers a candidate is determined by their RGB distance to that candidate. It actually started <a href="/vote">here</a> and then I learned D3 to make <a href="https://dontplaywithculi.netlify.app/charts/rcv">this</a> which soon turned into <a href="https://dontplaywithculi.netlify.app/votevote">an exploration</a> of a few more. Then it finally got it's own domain at <a href="https://votevote.page/">votevote.page</a>!
      </p>
      <p>
        The first attempt to collect my miniprojects happened at <a href="/toys">/toys</a> and was made with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. Then I decided to try a create-react-app for <a href="https://dontplaywithculi.netlify.app/">my second attempt</a> at it. I made some architectural mistakes I eventually got fed up with enough to make a third attempt at <a href="https://dontplay.netlify.app/">dontplay.netlify.app</a>. Still a create-react-app and I haven&apos;t even finished setting it up. But since then I&apos;ve tried out Svelte, Elm, Next.js, Preact, and a few other alternatives to the one big SPA approach CRA lends itself for. So I'm researching micro-frontends to see if I can still do it all in one for my next big iteration of this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other places you may find remnants of my projects are <a href="https://codepen.io/tif-calin">CodePen</a> (a few experiments), Are.na (not yet), <a href="https://replit.com/@CuliTif">ReplIt</a> (a few slightly larger experiments), <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/culi">FreeCodeCamp</a> (I actually never really learned much here but I like the community), Dribble (not yet), <a href="https://openprocessing.org/user/331632">OpenProcessing</a> (not much there yet)

      <h3>Functioning projects</h3>
      <p>Here&apos;s some stuff you can actually play with.</p>
      <h4 class="list-label">Mostly my own works</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://votevote.page/">VoteVote</a>

      <h4 class="list-label">Worked on with other people</h4>

        <li><a href="http://www.citypark.world/">citypark</a></li>

      </ul>
      <hr class="soft" />
      <h3 class="list-label">Unfinished projects</h3>
      <p>
        This will probably be the most in depth because the possibility of someone "stealing" my idea and wanting to do/finish these projects thrills me (though I recognize the unlikelihood).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I had big plans for this highly-specific <a href="https://angry-joliot-5a3345.netlify.app/">portfolios project</a> aiming to aggregate and highlight the <b class="semi">portfolio websites</b> of other developers. Kinda started with me trying to collect inspo, but I got really excited about implementing this tag-based voting system that I never actually implemented
        </li>
        <li>
          This one didn&apos;t even get passed the "market research" phase to see what similar projects already exist out there, but it was a very interesting investigation so I wanna share anyways. I've always wanted to build a <b class="semi">learning resource aggregator</b> mean to be extensible for learning pretty much anything. This is a natural evolution from my hobby of creating syllabi for myself to some day follow and study a particular subject. However, as usual, <a href="https://dontplaywithculi.netlify.app/learn">I discovered I&apos;m far from the first to have this idea</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Here&apos;s some <a href="https://dontplaywithculi.netlify.app/partisanlean">graphs showing how each <b class="semi">US State&apos;s Partisan Lean Index</b></a> has changed over the years since 1968. The PLI is a measure of how a state votes relative to the nation as a whole. My plan
        </li>
        <li>
          This one&apos;s more straightforward. I was trying to play with some new styles I hadn't tried much of before and I ended up using a <a href="https://dontplay.netlify.app/compost">compost guide</a> as my excuse to do so. Has some cute easter eggs which I spent a good amount of time on and is probably the reason I didn&apos;t finish, haha. I'll probably submit it to <a href="https://whimsical.club/">whimsical.club</a> if I do finish it.

      <h2>Other cornors of the internet I crawl</h2>
      <p>
        Other places I maintain an internet presence but won't link here include BookWyrm, Mastodon, Wikipedia, iNaturalist, various forums (votingtheory.org, bananas.org, talkelections.org, and hackernews). Accounts I'm ashamed to hold include LinkedIn, Reddit, and Twitter. I also like coding challenge sites like codewars.com, exercism.org, and, yes, even leetcode.com.
