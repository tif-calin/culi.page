        My name is Culi (<i>kuh-lee</i>). I use <a href="https://pronoun.is/they/.../themselves">they/them</a> or <a href="https://pronoun.is/they/.../themself">he/him</a> pronouns. I play with <a href="https://github.com/tif-calin/">code a lot</a> (currently mainly JS, TS, Ruby, and Python), but if you're here for that you probably meant to check out <a href="https://work.culi.page">my portfolio site</a>! Although I really enjoy coding, code tends to mainly act as the glue that allows me to tie together my varied interests including, but not limited to:

      <h2>What&apos;s there to do here?</h2>
      <p>
        I do this thing where I make some main repo for my million of quick project ideas. Usually it serves as a nest for projects and if I'm really into it I'll spin it up into a separate project. A good example is my project VoteVote which is a little toy I'm working on to allow you to compare dozens of different voting systems in one go using color as a metaphor. Voters and candidates are both represented by color and how much a voter prefers a candidate is determined by their RGB distance to that candidate. It actually started <a href="/vote">here</a> and then I learned D3 to make <a href="https://dontplaywithculi.netlify.app/charts/rcv">this</a> which soon turned into <a href="https://dontplaywithculi.netlify.app/votevote">an exploration</a> of a few more. Then it finally got it's own domain at <a href="https://votevote.page/">votevote.page</a>!
      </p>
      <p>
        The first attempt to collect my miniprojects happened at <a href="/toys">/toys</a> and was made with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. Then I decided to try a create-react-app for <a href="https://dontplaywithculi.netlify.app/">my second attempt</a> at it. I made some architectural mistakes I eventually got fed up with enough to make a third attempt at <a href="https://dontplay.netlify.app/">dontplay.netlify.app</a>. Still a create-react-app and I haven&apos;t even finished setting it up. But since then I&apos;ve tried out Svelte, Elm, Next.js, Preact, and a few other alternatives to the one big SPA approach CRA lends itself for. So I'm researching micro-frontends to see if I can still do it all in one for my next big iteration of this.

      <h3 class="list-label">Unfinished projects</h3>
      <p>
        Steal these ideas! Or collab with me!
      </p>
      <ul>
        <!--partisan lean-->
        <li>
          Here&apos;s some <a href="https://dontplaywithculi.netlify.app/partisanlean">graphs showing how each <b class="semi">US State&apos;s Partisan Lean Index</b></a> has changed over the years since 1968. The PLI is a measure of how a state votes relative to the nation as a whole. My plan was to add timestamps of when major voting access related laws were passed in different states and see if that tended to affect the partisan leans over time.
        </li>
        <!--ascii dataviz-->
        <li>
          One thing that&apos;s really captivated me recently is ASCII-based charting libraries like <a href="https://github.com/chunqiuyiyu/ervy">ervy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kroitor/asciichart">asciichart</a>. Besides enabling console-based data visualization, they just look really cool. I&apos;ve been cataloguing all the different libraries I've come across in a big yaml file with the languages they&apos; for and which visualizations they support. My plan is to make an <a href="https://github.com/kroitor/asciichart">accessible</a> dataviz catalog in the vein of <a href="https://datavizproject.com/">DVP by ferdio</a>. I even managed to snag the dataviz.gallery domain! (HMU if you want to help with this).
        </li>
        <!--portfolio websites gallery-->
        <li>
          I had big plans for this highly-specific <a href="https://angry-joliot-5a3345.netlify.app/">portfolios project</a> aiming to aggregate and highlight the <b class="semi">portfolio websites</b> of other developers. Kinda started with me trying to collect inspo, but I got really excited about implementing this tag-based voting system that I never actually implemented. I originally started on this because I was looking for inspo for my own personal portfolio site. But since then I've also began collecting niche programming language websites, political campaign websites, one-off conference/events websites, and small business websites. So part of me is wondering about a more generalized system for crowdsourcing these types of collections.
        </li>
        <!--learning resources aggregator-->
        <li>
          This one didn&apos;t even get passed the "market research" phase to see what similar projects already exist out there, but it was a very interesting investigation so I wanna share anyways. I've always wanted to build a <b class="semi">learning resource aggregator</b> mean to be extensible for learning pretty much anything. This is a natural evolution from my hobby of creating syllabi for myself to some day follow and study a particular subject. However, as usual, <a href="https://dontplaywithculi.netlify.app/learn">I discovered I&apos;m far from the first to have this idea</a>.
        </li>
        <!--compost guide-->
        <li>
          This one&apos;s more straightforward. I was trying to play with some new styles I hadn't tried much of before and I ended up using a <a href="https://dontplay.netlify.app/compost">compost guide</a> as my excuse to do so. Has some cute easter eggs which I spent a good amount of time on and is probably the reason I didn&apos;t finish, haha. I'll probably submit it to <a href="https://whimsical.club/">whimsical.club</a> if I do finish it.
        </li>
        <!--read later-->
        <li>
          My attempt at organizing my million bookmarks and playing with some cool generalized UI is <a href="https://dontplaywithculi.netlify.app/readlater">readlater</a>. The short-term goal was to implement a tag-based system for all of my bookmarks. I have widespanning interests but like to stay focused on specific topics at certain points in my life. I&apos;d like to use this to group together similar articles/books/podcasts/documentaries so I can watch them together and make it feel more like a "deep dive" than me bouncing from interest to interest. Long-term goal is to open it up to anyone so that you can also prioritize what you&apos;re reading based on your friends or community&apos;s interests
        </li>
        <!--seasonal fruit chart-->
        <li>
          I made this cute <a href="https://dontplaywithculi.netlify.app/charts">seasonal fruit chart</a>. Don&apos;t have big plans or anything. Just wanna expand the functionality to let people add more fruit and export as a png or something.
        </li>
        <!--slay clone-->
        <li>
          I&apos;m making an <a href="https://osgameclones.com/">open source game clone</a> of Sean O&apos; Conner&apos;s <a href="http://www.windowsgames.co.uk/slay.html">Slay</a>. Mostly because I think it&apos;s what I need to finally stop playing this silly game but also as an excuse to learn <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> and playing with <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons-v2/implementation.html">hex grids</a>.
        </li>
        <!--only you'd-->
        <li>
          There&apos;s this fun party game me and some friends played a lot called Loaded Questions. You get a question, everyone anonymously answers and then you go around trying to guess who wrote which answer. Simple idea but loads of fun. I wanted to make an open-sourced online version of this during the pandemic. I called it "<a href="https://only-youd.vercel.app/">Only You&apos;d</a> and made a non-functioning website for it, but then I got a job haha. I still have a collection of 248 questions that I hand typed (most of which are totally original) which you can <a href="https://culi.page/load/">still access here</a>.
        </li>
        <!--color names x culture-->
        <!--color spaces expanded-->
        <!--wiki tools-->
        <!--linklink browser extension-->
