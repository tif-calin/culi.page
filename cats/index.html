      <h2>goal</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>build a set of webscrapers for different cat food brands to automatically get product information like ingredients, guaranteed analysis, and calorie density</li>
        <li>build a dataset of catfood ingredients that takes into account that different products will use different names for the same thing. Use this data to show statistics on the frequency of certain ingredients in different foods/brands</li>
        <li>research each catfood ingredient to find information about how safe it is for cats, the ecological impact, etc</li>
        <li>build a dataset of different brands and who manufactures them and what past recalls have been associated with those manufacturers and other measures of manufacturer quality</li>
        <li>build a powerful search feature that allows people to create custom quality gradings using their own ideas of how much weight to place on, e.g. the amount of manufacturer recalls per year</li>
        <li>allow people to post their own sightings of different catfoods at different stores so we can compare prices and let people find the best quality foods for the cheapest price. Also help people find which stores gives the best deals on quality catfood</li>
